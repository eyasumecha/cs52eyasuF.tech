            <p>Right after this, they faced a 27 year drought. They came close a couple of times, but they never won again.
                Their fans were desperate, the glory days were over.

            <p>But despite Liverpool not having enjoyed a premier league title for a while, they had countless success in other competitions.
                They had a great love affair with the Champions League title, which is the European competition among the biggest club. 
                And Liverpool had won that 5 times. In addition they enjoyed a lot of domestic cup success. Jurgen Kloop won them the 
                6th Champions League title, and added even more domestic and international cup to their trophy cabinets.
